## NEW: The first bio foundation model with chain-of-thought inference 🧠⚙️🧠⚙️🧠

Given CpGPT's generative capabilities, we have implemented an analogous version of the chain-of-thought used in NLP tasks but for the reconstruction of methylation patterns. For more information about the method, please check out our [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.24.619766v1). To try it out yourself, please go to the [quick setup tutorial](https://github.com/lcamillo/CpGPT/blob/main/tutorials/quick_setup.ipynb).

## 📖 Overview

CpGPT is a foundation model for DNA methylation, trained on genome-wide DNA methylation data. It can generate, impute, and embed methylation profiles, and can be finetuned for various downstream tasks.

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
- AWS CLI (for downloading dependencies)

### Installation Instructions

We recommend using `poetry` for installation:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/lcamillo/CpGPT.git
cd CpGPT

# Install poetry if not available
pip install poetry

# Install dependencies with Poetry
poetry install
```

Alternatively, the package is available through:

```bash
# Install with pip
pip install CpGPT
```

<summary><b>Directory Layout</b></summary>

The CpGCorpus is organized in a hierarchical structure by GSE (Gene Series) and further by GPL (Platform). Below is an overview of the directory layout and file contents:

```
cpgcorpus/
  └── raw/
      └── {GSE_ID}/
          └── {GPL_ID}/
              ├── betas/
              │   ├── QCDPB.arrow      # Processed beta values via the R sesame QCDPB pipeline
              │   └── gse_betas.arrow  # Raw beta values downloaded from GEO
              └── metadata/
                  └── metadata.arrow   # Metadata and sample annotations
```

- The "betas" folder contains one of the two files:
  - QCDPB.arrow: Processed data from the R sesame QCDPB pipeline.
  - gse_betas.arrow: Beta values as originally downloaded from GEO.
- The "metadata" folder stores the metadata.arrow file that holds supplementary experimental details.

## 🔧 Finetuning

> ⚠️ **Warning**: Fine-tuning CpGPT models requires a GPU. The training process is computationally intensive and will be extremely slow or may fail entirely without GPU acceleration. We recommend at least 8GB of VRAM for the small model and 24GB+ for the large model.

<summary><b>Getting Started</b></summary>

1. **Download dependencies** if you have not already done so by following the steps in the <a href="tutorials/quick_setup.ipynb">quick setup tutorial notebook</a>.

2. **Prepare your data** by following the steps in the <a href="tutorials/quick_setup.ipynb">quick setup tutorial notebook</a>. If you would like to predict a variable (e.g. age), add the argument metadata_cols to the datasaver:.

```python
datasaver = CpGPTDataSaver(
    data_paths=ARROW_DF_FILTERED_PATH,
    processed_dir=PROCESSED_DIR,
    metadata_cols=["age_col_name"],
)
```

<summary><b>Configuration</b></summary>

1. **Create a configuration file** by modifying template in `configs/experiment/`.

2. **Run fine-tuning** with the CLI:

```bash
cpgpt-train experiment=template
```

3. **Get the best checkpoint** in the logs folders:

- **Checkpoint weights**: `logs/experiment/{experiment_name}/checkpoints/{experiment_name}.ckpt`

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>📊 Task-Specific Settings</b></summary>

Modify these parameters in your experiment YAML file to customize the model for different tasks:

```yaml
model:
  training:
    # Type of loss function for condition decoder
    condition_decoder_loss: mae  # Options: mae, mse, ce

    # Weighting for the condition loss vs reconstruction
    loss_weights:
      condition_loss: 0.1

  optimizer:
    # Learning rate

  net:
    # Enable the condition decoder for prediction tasks
    use_condition_decoder: true

    # Number of target variables to predict
    condition_size: 1  # 1 for regression, can be >1 for multi-target
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>⚙️ Training Parameters</b></summary>

Control the training process with these settings:

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>What methylation array platforms are supported?</b></summary>
CpGPT was pretrained with bulk data from all of the available Illumina arrays, besides the Horvath Mammalian array, at the time of writing. Nevertheless, CpGPT should be able to generalize to new arrays and unseen genomic loci. For RRBS and other types of sequencing-based methylation measurements, finetuning with at least a subset of the data is highly recommended.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How much data do I need to fine-tune CpGPT?</b></summary>
CpGPT can be fine-tuned with as few as 50-100 samples for simple tasks. For complex tasks or higher accuracy, we recommend 500+ samples.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Should I filter the CpG sites prior to finetuning?</b></summary>
That depends on the task and the reason for finetuning. For instance, to finetune for a model that does not predict specific phenotypes and is just used to learn whole-genome methylation profiles, then it is best not to filter any features. However, if there is a specific phenotype to be predicted, then using a ridge regression and picking the top N features can speed up the training time required (see below).
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How many steps should I finetune it for?</b></summary>
That ultimately depends on how many samples and how many features are shown to the model. As a rough guide, showing CpGPT each sample-feature combination 50 times works well. For instance, if there are 100 samples with 10,000 CpG sites each, then with a batch size of 10, 100,000 steps would be ideal.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How can I get the very best possible performance?</b></summary>
One trick that can increase training time substantially but can lead to some minor performance improvements is to change the following parameter in the `template.yaml` file:

```yaml
model:
  training:
    generative_splits: 5
```

The default for that parameter is 2, which effectively means that generative training is not used.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I use CpGPT for commercial purposes?</b></summary>
Yes, CpGPT is licensed under the MIT License, which allows commercial use. However, there is one specific restriction: the software cannot be used to participate in biomarkers of aging challenges, competitions, contests, or any competitive events that offer monetary prizes or financial rewards related to aging biomarkers or longevity research.
